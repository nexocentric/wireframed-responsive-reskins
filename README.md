This project is based off of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Creative_Commons-licensed_websites) list of Creative Common licensed websites.

This is being done purely for practice so that I could get used to the tools that I have chosen for doing web design.

These will all be remixes, but the initial wireframe for each site will be based on the sites listed in the attribution section.
